# Library Management System

This is my high school final project for Computer Science subject. We'd been tasked with implementing a program that integerates with MySQL. I chose to go with Library Management as the topic as it was easy to plan and implement. This project was built without much prior knowledge about GUI development or about error management in python and therefore contains some unconventional but custome logic for those.
